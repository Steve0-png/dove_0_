Correspondence is important, and I promise, I’m autistic, not scary.<br><br>Ask for an example of realistic portraits! I will not publically show some examples that I have as they are mostly of real people.</p>
                    <p>I tend to not do lineart and, in the case of portrait, I may also not have a sketch. If you want these, you can of course ask, though in that stage of art, it will not be as good as I would do if I were paid for a sketch, as I develop most details later in a piece.</p>

                    <p>Once finished, I will email you a png of the piece. If that does not work for any reason, I will share it with you through either Google Drive or Onedrive. I am willing to try other options of sending the finished product if you ask!</p>

                    <p>If you have any lingering questions or comments, once again, please talk to me! I want to try to make this work with you as well as I can. Know that pricing is ultimately up to me and I hold the right to adjust the price until payment is agreed upon and delivered.</p>
